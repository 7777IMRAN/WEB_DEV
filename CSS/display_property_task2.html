    <h1 id="k">Agro Techniques</h1>
   <p class="l">Around 10,000 years ago, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> catalyzed an epochal transformation. Humanity transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to stable agricultural communities. This transition bore witness to the domestication of vital plants and animals, including wheat, barley, and livestock, fundamentally altering the agricultural landscape. The surplus food production that ensued fueled population growth and laid the cornerstone for nascent civilizations. Irrigation technology was developed independently by a number of different cultures, with the earliest known examples dated to the 6th millennium BCE in Khuzistan in the south-west of present-day Iran.[5][6] The ancient Egyptian use of the Nile River's flooding, marked another significant advancement.</p>
   <p class="l">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">roman era</a> ushered in notable contributions to agricultural technology. The Romans introduced innovative implements, such as the Roman plough, a notable refinement in soil cultivation. In tandem, they compiled comprehensive agricultural manuals like "De Re Rustica," serving as invaluable records of contemporary farming techniques.</p>
   <p class="l">The Middle Ages bequeathed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages">significant agricultural progress</a>. Concepts like crop rotation and the three-field system enhanced soil fertility and crop yields, while the introduction of the heavy plow, driven by draft animals, facilitated the cultivation of previously uncultivated lands.</p>
   <p class="l">Agro-textiles is the segmented class of <a href="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_textile">technical textiles</a> that deals focuses on the agriculture sector, with an approach to crop protection and crop development and reducing the risks of farming practices. Primarily agro-textiles offer weather resistance and resistance to microorganisms and protection from unwanted elements and external factors. Agro-textiles helps to improve the overall conditions with which crop can develop and be protected. There are the various textile products, fabrics forms, fibers and techniques used in agro-textiles which are useful for agriculture mainly for crop protection and in crop development for instance shade nets, thermal insulation and sunscreen materials, windshield, antibird nets, which provide minimal shading and proper temperature, air circulation for protecting plants from direct sunlight and birds. Agrotextiles involves mulch mats, hail protection nets, and crop covers, etc. Agro-textiles are useful in Horticulture, aquaculture, landscape gardening and forestry also. More examples of use and application are covering livestock protection, suppressing weed and insect control, </p>

   <div id="org"><h1 class="a">Organic Farming</h1>
                <p>Organic farming, also known as ecological farming or biological farming, is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.</p>
                <p>Organic farming continues to be developed by various organizations today. Biological pest control, mixed cropping, and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div id="con"><h1 class="a">Conventional Farming</h1>
            <p>Conventionally grown is an agriculture term referring to a method of growing edible plants (such as fruit and vegetables) and other products. It is opposite to organic growing methods which attempt to produce without synthetic chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, hormones) or genetically modified organisms. Conventionally grown products, meanwhile, often use fertilizers and pesticides which allow for higher yield, out of season growth, greater resistance, greater longevity and a generally greater mass. Conventionally grown fruit: PLU code consists of 4 numbers . Organically grown fruit: PLU code consists of 5 numbers and begins with  Genetically engineered fruit: PLU code consists of 5 numbers and begins with .Conventional farming is usually contrasted to organic farming (or sometimes sustainable agriculture or permaculture), as these respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.[1] Rather than using synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives, organic farming systems rely on crop rotation, animal and plant manures as fertilizers, some hand weeding and biological pest control.[2] Some conventional agriculture operations may include limited polyculture, or some form of Integrated Pest Management. see Industrial organic agriculture</p>

        <div id="gen"><h1 class="a" >Geniric Farming</h1>
        <p>“Generic Farming and Organic Farming. Farming in which as much use is made of the land as possible by. growing crops close together or by growing several crops in a year or. by using large amounts of fertilizers. "As farming has become more specialised and practices like manuring have gone, so the level of organic matter in the soil has decreased," said Dick Thompson, a development officer. "That causes a hard cap to form on soil, which prevents water from seeping into the ground. If we can control water before it reaches rivers we will have a chance of success against the floods." Water is the essential element which gives life to the world we live in. If we raise the quality of water, we get better final product, color, aroma, smell, yield or animal metabolism. In the intensive farming, the irrigation water generally contains high values of bicarbonates and other chemical elements that influence the pH, raising it to high levels, which induces deprivation of nutrients.”</p>

    <div id="com"><h1 class="a">Community Farming</h1>
    <p>People who care about protecting farmland and healthy, local food come together to build and support community farms in their neighbourhoods. Some assist the community groups that are needed to govern the farm, some want to farm and value the collaborative approach of the community farm model, and others simply wish to enjoy fresh, healthy food, or visit a farm.

        Community farming offers many benefits to farmers who want to practice sustainable agriculture and to communities who want fresh, healthy, locally-produced food. By supporting community farms, local communities can invest directly in their food system, secure farmland for the future, help create sources of healthy, locally-produced food, and enjoy social, economic, environmental, and agricultural benefits.</p></div>
